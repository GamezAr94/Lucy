## Details
The player is a firefly. The player has to collect items to be able to see the environment and avoid crashing with obstacles or enemies.

1. The player moves around the screen with the arrow keys.
2. the firefly gets energy when it grabs the items, 
3. the items appear randomly in the screen,
4. the game is over when the firefly runs out of light.

## Technical Specifications 
- C#
- Unity2D
- Parallax scroll system
- Particle system
- Lighting manipulation 
- 2d animation

## What I learn
- How to use masks in unity to hide elements, in this particular case I am hiding sprites when there is no light and I show them when there is light.
- Random position system to generate items in random positions in the Y axis.
- How to generate particles when the player moves and in the items.
- parallax system to move the screen with a given speed.
